# FoodWebsite
This is the Food ordering website from web development developed by Rahul Dev
In order to use this project you need to install xampp and create folder name food_order_project in htdocs folder so that you can use localhost to test this project.
And also you need to create database called food-order and add sql file in phpmyadmin dashboard.
Thank you..
